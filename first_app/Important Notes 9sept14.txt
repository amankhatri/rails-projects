creating domoapp for users and micro posts using scaffolding. However scaffolding is used initially tto give the
first taste of MCV programing. You do not really develop an application using Scaffolding, so this will be the first and the last application which we create using scaffolding. Scaffolding is really cheating, it generates 
everything automatically and it may no make sense initially. 
we will have to learn about Resources and the Representational State transfer(REST) architecture.

after creating an app you have to think what kind of application you have to create. So we need to
create microblogs and we would need users (id,name and email) and then we would need microposts with collumns(id , content and user_id which would correspond to the id from users which would be a 
foreign key in microposts to link users to micropst). Rails generates the id field automatically for all the models. so to generate  user model you will do
 rails g scaffold user name:string email:string
This generates a proper database to manupulate name, and email of user model to store in database.
to prepare the data base we do
rake db:migrate

When web Browser hits /users, the rails router
(routes.rb) directs the application to index action, index is used as default page in web, in one of the controllers in our app in this case users_controllers.rb which then talks to model (users.rb) which returns users as ruby array from the database to controller (users_controllers). Then controller gives the info to view (@users) and view returns it to controller using html protocol and controller sends it to browser.
resources :users makes tons of routes, we will learn in near future
so the word action refers ruby function, covered in future (Chapter 4)
users_controller
when you do /users , the the router calls the index action from users_controller
@user is variable, 
and User.all means User class and all method which gets called from models folder
/app/models/user.rb look into the specific files
model is incharge of talking to controller not the db
#ruby uses "<" this for inheritance. 
#activeRecord is the default lib defined from rails and base is the class
/app/views/index.html.erb . this is ruby embedded html files, 
rails allows you to embed ruby in html
The variable in controller, @user gets passed to views
The embedded ruby gets passed onto controller in form of html
look at the images too
there are four http request which users have get , post , put, delete. This is REST. REST consists of structues of url actions and http requests. Look at the image for list of http request url action and purpose.
resources:users associates the default http requests to display different urls associated with controllers, and views.
Scaffolding also create test but it is rudimentory.
to rollback database you do 
rake db:rollback
and to destroy/ delete controller or the files created by rails g command
rails distroy scaffold Micropost
note all the the http request remains same and has standardzed thing.
/app/models/micropost.rb
all the constraints 
validates :content, :length=> {:maximum => 140}
:content is ruby symbol
:length is the key 
:maximum is another key
so when you apply constraints to model it travels all the way up to views. 
How foreign key works in jpg (micropost_user_association). Now we will implement the relation in the /app/models/micropost.rb 
	in /app/models/micropost.rb we will say belongs_to :user
	in /app/models/user.rb we will say has_many :microposts 
	notice there are diffrent , singular and plurals
	now we will see the relationship in rails console - in cmd run rails console
	run User.all
	Note: when you run rails g it generates classes 
	user = User.first  , here User is the model and first is the id

ActiveRecod::Base is the parent class of all models .
ActionController is the parent of all controllers and Application Controller inherits from ActionController, it redirects from urls and knows what kind of http request it is. So if we edit application controller all the things which 
we edit are inhered by users_controller.rb and microposts_controllers.rb

we will start with mostly static pages
we will be using respec for generating the test , however the default test  called test unit
so to suppress test unit we use  --skip-test-unit and this would prevent rails to generate the default test directory
 rails new sample_app --skip-test-unit
configure the right gems in gemsfile
now create rspec configuration file by doing 
rails generate rspec:install

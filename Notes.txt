we will start with mostly static pages
we will be using respec for generating the test , however the default test  called test unit
so to suppress test unit we use  --skip-test-unit and this would prevent rails to generate the default test directory
 rails new sample_app --skip-test-unit
configure the right gems in gemsfile
now create rspec configuration file by doing 
rails generate rspec:install
rails has two ways of handling static pages
first is serving static html page from public directory. Static html means just the html file no embeded ruby or java or anything. just add a new file to public folder and name is filename.html and that would be static html page
now the other way to create html file is through rails stack in view and controller part. For our app we will have home page, about page and a contact page. Since we have static pages , we would like to have a controller with one action per page by running the command
rails generate controller Pages home contact
we will intentionally forget about the about page and add it manually later
now look at the config\routes.rb now instead of resources we have get request defined for 
home and contact pages. 
now do http:/localhost:3000/pages/home.html
this brings up the pages in app/views/pages/home.html.erb
if you delete the home method from the controllers file right now and go the http:/localhost:3000/pages/home.html link , the rails will still bring up the page by implicit actions.

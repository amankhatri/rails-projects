we will start with mostly static pages
we will be using respec for generating the test , however the default test  called test unit
so to suppress test unit we use  --skip-test-unit and this would prevent rails to generate the default test directory

 rails new sample_app --skip-test-unit

configure the right gems in gemsfile
now create rspec configuration file by doing 

rails generate rspec:install

rails has two ways of handling static pages
first is serving static html page from public directory. Static html means just the html file no embeded ruby or java or anything. just add a new file to public folder and name is filename.html and that would be static html page
now the other way to create html file is through rails stack in view and controller part. For our app we will have home page, about page and a contact page. Since we have static pages , we would like to have a controller with one action per page by running the command

rails generate controller Pages home contact

we will intentionally forget about the about page and add it manually later
now look at the config\routes.rb now instead of resources we have get request defined for 
home and contact pages. 
now do http:/localhost:3000/pages/home.html
this brings up the pages in app/views/pages/home.html.erb
if you delete the home method from the controllers file right now and go the http:/localhost:3000/pages/home.html link , the rails will still bring up the page by implicit actions.
we are doing teset driven development and we will write test before making the application 
for this purpose we will write a test for About page and then we will see the test fail
now we will remove the unwanted files from the rails application which gets generated automatically.
so we will remove spec/views/

git rm -r spec/views

and we will remove spec/helpers

git rm -r spec/helpers

we will test our application in controllers views. However every one has their own preference all it matters is you should test, now if we see the the spec ditectory  there is 1)Controllers directory and 2) spec_helper.rb.
In Controllers directory we have Controllers pages_controller_spec.rb.
even if we don't have anyhing yet, to run our test we will do 

rpec spec/

this error occured 
C:\Users\Aman\Documents\GitHub\rails-projects\sample_app>rspec spec/

untime.rb:34:in `block in setup': You have already activated rspec-core 3.1.4, b
ut your Gemfile requires rspec-core 2.13.1. Prepending `bundle exec` to your com
mand may solve this. (Gem::LoadError)
to deal with error execute

 gem install rspec -v 2.13.0
 add gem minitest to gemfile
 run bundle install

Run the spec using

$ bundle exec rspec spec/

This will ensure the command is executed with the same version listed in your Gemfile.

rspec leads to too much time over head and to reduce it we can install spork -- I am not doing it.
now we have something called autotest which can we install.
we will now generate test which would lead to failure. now spec/pages_controller_spec.rb is a ruby file and rpec exploits maliability of ruby to make a DSL which is domain specific language

  describe "GET 'home'" do
    it "returns http success" do
      get 'home'  <-- get is a function which generates a 				get request
      response.should be_success <-- success refers to what 							do you get in return you should get some page
    end
  end

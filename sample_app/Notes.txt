we will start with mostly static pages
we will be using respec for generating the test , however the default test  called test unit
so to suppress test unit we use  --skip-test-unit and this would prevent rails to generate the default test directory

 rails new sample_app --skip-test-unit

configure the right gems in gemsfile
now create rspec configuration file by doing 

rails generate rspec:install

rails has two ways of handling static pages
first is serving static html page from public directory. Static html means just the html file no embeded ruby or java or anything. just add a new file to public folder and name is filename.html and that would be static html page
now the other way to create html file is through rails stack in view and controller part. For our app we will have home page, about page and a contact page. Since we have static pages , we would like to have a controller with one action per page by running the command

rails generate controller Pages home contact

we will intentionally forget about the about page and add it manually later
now look at the config\routes.rb now instead of resources we have get request defined for 
home and contact pages. 
now do http:/localhost:3000/pages/home.html
this brings up the pages in app/views/pages/home.html.erb
if you delete the home method from the controllers file right now and go the http:/localhost:3000/pages/home.html link , the rails will still bring up the page by implicit actions.
we are doing teset driven development and we will write test before making the application 
for this purpose we will write a test for About page and then we will see the test fail
now we will remove the unwanted files from the rails application which gets generated automatically.
so we will remove spec/views/

git rm -r spec/views

and we will remove spec/helpers

git rm -r spec/helpers

we will test our application in controllers views. However every one has their own preference all it matters is you should test, now if we see the the spec ditectory  there is 1)Controllers directory and 2) spec_helper.rb.
In Controllers directory we have Controllers pages_controller_spec.rb.
even if we don't have anyhing yet, to run our test we will do 

rpec spec/

this error occured 
C:\Users\Aman\Documents\GitHub\rails-projects\sample_app>rspec spec/
C:/RailsInstaller/Ruby1.9.3/lib/ruby/gems/1.9.1/gems/bundler-1.6.2/lib/bundler/r
untime.rb:34:in `block in setup': You have already activated rspec-core 3.1.4, b
ut your Gemfile requires rspec-core 2.13.1. Prepending `bundle exec` to your com
mand may solve this. (Gem::LoadError)
to deal with error execute

 gem install rspec -v 2.13.0
 add gem minitest to gemfile
 run bundle install

Run the spec using

$ bundle exec rspec spec/

This will ensure the command is executed with the same version listed in your Gemfile.

rspec leads to too much time over head and to reduce it we can install spork -- I am not doing it.
now we have something called autotest which can we install.
we will now generate test which would lead to failure. now spec/pages_controller_spec.rb is a ruby file and rpec exploits maliability of ruby to make a DSL which is domain specific language

  describe "GET 'home'" do
    it "returns http success" do
      get 'home'  <-- get is a function which generates a 				get request
      response.should be_success <-- success refers to what 							do you get in return you should get some page
    end
  end
  now we create a test
  and we go to pages_controller_spec.rb and write a 
  test for pages controller
    describe "GET 'about'" do
    it "returns http success" do
      get 'about'
      response.should be_success
    end
  end

  re run the test
  ops, 
  routes missing
  enter the routes
  --pages/about
  rereun the test
  ops,
  we haven't defined the about page in pages_controller

 def about
 end

 re run the test 
 ops, 
 we don't have a view for about
 go to app/view
 create about.html
 v-19, 
 Goal: Static pages and a little bit of dynamic page
 we will change the titles of the pages about,contact and home
 --writing a test in pages_controller_spec.rb
  it "should have the right title" do
    get 'home'
    response.should have_selector("title",
      :content => "Ruby on Rails Tutorial Sample App | Home")
  end
  here have_selector is a method
  in which we mention the html tag of which we want to write test for.
  and variable content => shoud contain the text and | is pipeline
  runs the test,
  test fails ops
  now we have to edit home.html.erb
  runs the test
  test fails ops, 
  however we have made the right page the test fails. The
  reason being the fact that we initially removed the feature for testing views 7 helpers using rspec. Hence we would have to check it using the controllers page. so to achieve that we will write render_view under the line
	describe PagesController. like this	
	describe PagesController do
    render_views
   now we have changed all the html pages and and we run the test -- which are still failing 0_o and I do not know why.
   Any who, 
   when you go to any of the pages using rails s in the browser, you will notice that the title on the source code in the browser is sample app. This is because of the layouts.
   go to app/views/layouts/application.html.erb
   you will see this  :

   	<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>SampleApp</title>
  <%= stylesheet_link_tag    'application', media: 'all', 'data-turbolinks-track' => true %>
  <%= javascript_include_tag 'application', 'data-turbolinks-track' => true %>
  <%= csrf_meta_tags %>
</head>
<body>

<%= yield %>

</body>
</html>

for time being we are getting rid of it but we will bring it back

run command rm app/views/layouts/application.html.erb

now since the application.html.erb is removed go to web browser and refresh the page. now we have the right title.
test are still failing if you are wondering about it 0_p
notice we have similar pages, everything in the home, about and contact page is same except the body so we will reduce this duplication. We will now configure the controller to have our view rendered properly. To do this the steps are:
	we will add something to each page and make the title look almost same, this will be done using embedded ruby.
	go to the pages_controller and do this:   
def home
  	@title = "Home"
end
now I will go to the home.html.erb and do this :
<title>Ruby on Rails Tutorial Sample App | <%= @title %>/title>
now this is dynamic html.
<%= @title %> this inserts the content of @title variable to the html page from controller.
now do this for all three pages and controller methods
  def contact
  	@title = "Contact"
  end

  def about
  	@title = "About"
  end
end

NOTE: REMEMBER THE SCOPE OF VARIABLE TITLE IS JUST IN THAT METHOD.
test are still failing :c
now it would be benificial to clump the title of all the pages in one file since all titles are same in html pages about home and contact
<title>Ruby on Rails Tutorial Sample App | <%= @title %>/title>
to achieve this we will restore application.html.erb which we had removed previously. this can be done by adding a new file application.html.erb

now we will cut this :
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<head>
		<title>Ruby on Rails Tutorial Sample App |<%= @title %></title>
	</head>
	<body>
	</body>
</html>
from all the files (home, about , contact)
and add it to application.html.erb
now if we go to the web page in the browser we see nothing, 
that is because we don't have anything in body of application.html.erb file.
so now before doing that we will right the test to make sure the body is not empty
go to pages_controller_spec.rb and 
add this to section of home about and contact page
    it "should have a non-blank body" do
      get 'home'
      response.body.should_not =~//
    end
 where /<body>\s*<\/body>/ <--- is  regular expression which means matching text of the body or body content with blank content. 
 go to rubular check it out its ia a ruby regular expression editors.
now insert the body in application.html.erb using ebedded ruby 
we do this by entring  yield 
<%= yield %> which is related to ruby block and what we are doing is we are yielding the details of about home and contact page. so what yiled would do is insert the content of home contact and about page instead of yield in application.html.erb
we do not have to write the test for body for each of home contact and about page because we handle everything though one layout. so we only make one test.
in rails 3 we have a meta tag:
<%= csrf_meta_tag %>
which is I included in application.html.erb file. 
crsf_meta_tag which is a ruby function and is cross site
request forgery.  It prevent a perticular kind of attack.

<------------------------------------------------------>
L-4a introduction to rails helper for page titles
css inclusion 
and to learn run function conditions and data structures
when i say lay out file I mean application.html.erb
in this file, eapplication.html.erb we have title 
<title>Ruby on Rails Tutorial Sample App |<%= @title %></title> 
which we can specialize using helpers in app/helpers/application_helper.rb

	def title
		base_title = "Ruby on Rails Tutorial Sample App"
		if @title.nil?
			base_title
		else
			"#{base_title} | #{@title}"	
		end
	end

	now we can change application.html.erb from 
	<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<head>
		<title>Ruby on Rails Tutorial Sample App |<%= @title %></title>
		<%= csrf_meta_tag %>
	</head>
	<body>
		<%= yield %>
	</body>
</html>

to 

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<head>
		<title><%=title %></title>
		<%= csrf_meta_tag %>
	</head>
	<body>
		<%= yield %>
	</body>
</html>
so application.html.erb serves as a base templete and it takes it from applicaion_helper.rb. 
run in browser and see what happens

now delete  @title = "about"  temprorily from pages_Controller
  def about
  	@title = "About"
  end
  and run it in browser

rails consol 
runn rails c in cmd
ruby can do arthimatic and you cam pass  comments using 
#

"" #empty string
"foo" #non empty string
"foo" + "bar"  #concatination which results in
foobar
you can also do 
"foo".concat("bar")
for explaination of ruby look at application.html.erb 
below:
module ApplicationHelper
	#Return a title on a per page basis
	def title   #name of the method
		# local variable base_title
		base_title = "Ruby on Rails Tutorial Sample App"
		#@title is the global variable
		if @title.nil? #this is a boolean expression
			base_title
		else
			#evaluate base_title when you put hash in fron
			"#{base_title} | #{@title}"	
		end
	end


end


another example of ruby
first_name = "Michael" results in :
>> "Michael" 
"#{first_name}' Hartl"
>> "Michael Hartl"
last_name = "Hartl"
>> "Hartl"
# example of string interpolation
"#{first_name} #{last_name}" #this is much clear and is the convention
>> Michael hartel
"$first_name $last_name"

for example in the line 
"#{base_title} | #{@title}"	 of application_helper.rb
we are interpolating and saying evaluate base_title and title , pass the title by interpolation
to print the string in ruby we will do 
puts "foo" #example
and it returns nil
# results from command prompt
>>foo  
>>nil
we see we have nil and this is the side effect which means nothing. which means foo evaluates to nothing
we can also puts a variable
puts first_name
>> Michael
>>nil
when you do use print like this:
print first_name
it results to :
>>Michael => nil # we can undertand this by doing this by doing
print "#{first_name}\n"  which results  in 
>> Michael
>> nil 
which results in the same thing as it did for puts 
both of them gives the same results
 so far we have been talking about double quoted strings ruby also supports  single coated strings. so if we do this
 'foo' the results is
 >>"foo"  that is ruby returns in double quoted strings but there is a different beween double quotes and single quoted . so lets do this:
 "foo\n" results in
 >> "foo\n" 
 'foo\n' results in
 'foo\\n'
 as we can see the single quote string inclues a litertal \ we can get that by putting double slashed n .
 lets do 
 puts "foo\n" results in 
 >>foo 
 >>nil 
 now lets do 
 puts 'foo\n'
 >>foo\n
 >>nil
 single quoted strings puts out whatever it is gets in. 
 you can do this 
 "#{first_name} #{last_name}" results in 
 >> "Michael hartl"
 '#{first_name} #{last_name}' results
 >>"#{first_name} #{last_name}"
so single quote doesn't do interpolate at all
everything in ruby is an object andyou call methods on objects
lets try
"foobar".length
>>6
#any method with a question mark is a boolean method it takes either true or false. losts of method in ruby is boolean. sometimes there may be boolean which may not have a question mark
"foobar".empty? results in
>>false
lets try this:
"".empty?
>true
''.empty
>>true
the boolean strings are useful in control flow because in one case you want to do one thing and in another you want to do another thing
lets try
s = "foobar"
if s.empty?
"the string is empty"
else
"the string is not empty"
end
>>"the string is not empty"
in application_helper in the following line we have:
if @title.nil? which is a boolean method and @title is the isntance variable. notice I used the word return 
, ruby does have the return word but it doesn't change much for example we can have this in out application_helper.rb
		if @title.nil? #this is a boolean expression
		 return	base_title
		else
		 return	"#{base_title} | #{@title}"	
		end
by default ruby returns a last value evaluted in the method for returns
boolean methods can be used in cobination
x="foo"
>> "foo"
y = ""
>>nil
puts "Both Strings are empty" if x.empty> && y.empty?
>>nil
we can also do or statement
puts "one of the strings is empty" if x.empty> || y.empty?
>>one of the strings is empty.
ruby also has not operator
puts "x is not empty" if !x.empty?
ruby also has unless key word which can be used instead of not
puts "x is not empty" unless x.empty?
>>x is not empty
>>nil
empty method can be called for more stuff then just trings
lets try this
nil.empty? 
>> gives us  bunch of exceptions .
however we can convert nil to string by
nil.to_S
>>""
and we can call nested methods
nil.to_S.empty
>>true
now we will interpolate the nil
"#{nil}"
>>""
false and true are also methods  . false belongs to FalseClass
nil object always evaluates to false so if we do this
if nil 
 "hello"
 else
  "good bye"
  end   we get
  >>"good bye"

  things like 0 are true
  if 0
 "hello"
 else
  "good bye"
  end   we get
  >>"hello"
  !!nil results in
  >>false

  so everthing except false and nil are true
  method and function defintion
  function and method are same thing
  def string_message(something_crazy)
  	if something_crazy.nil?
  		"It's nil"
  	else
 		"Something"
    end
  end

 evaluates to 
 >>nil
 calling the method 
 string_message("")
 >>"it's something"
instance variables are nil when there is no value to it.
